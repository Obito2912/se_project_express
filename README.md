# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

### Project Description

This back-end project was created to improve even more the WTWR app and have more control over it. It provides a RESTful API for managing users and clothing items. It also includes item CRUD operations, like/dislike functionality, and proper error handling.

### Technologies Used

Node.js & Express — server and routing

MongoDB & Mongoose — database

Postman — API testing

Nodemon — development with auto-reload

REST principles — for route structure and HTTP status management
